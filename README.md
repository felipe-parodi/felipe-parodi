  PhD Candidate @ University of Pennsylvania

  I study how primate brains encode social intelligence and how these principles can inform artificial ones. My work combines neuroscience, machine learning, and animal behavior to model natural social cognition from neural, video, and audio data.

  ### Selected Work

  - **[Nature 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38480888/)** — Neural signatures of natural behavior in macaques
  - **[PrimateFace](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.12.669927v2)** — Cross-species primate facial analysis benchmark
  - **[awesome-computational-primatology](https://github.com/KordingLab/awesome-computational-primatology)** — Curated resource at the intersection of ML and primatology

  ### Currently

  - Finishing my PhD on the neural basis of social intelligence (mid-STS)
  - Building tools that bridge biological and artificial systems
  - Open to collaborations on computational approaches to neurobehavioral data
